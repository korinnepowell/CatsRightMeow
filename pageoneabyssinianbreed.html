        <h2>Abyssinian Cat Breed</h2>
        <p> The Abyssinian cat, or Aby cat for 
            short, is a domestic short-haired breed 
            with a ticked tabby coat. This means that 
            each hair has bands of different colors 
            and is a trademark of the breed. Ticked 
            hair is known as the agouti effect and 
            is a genetic variant of the tabby pattern 
            making the hair a uniform color all over 
            the body. However, the ridge of the spine 
            and tip of the tail, the back of the hind 
            legs, the paws, and the pads are always 
            noticeably darker. The Abyssinian has a 
            lifespan of 9-15 years and can grow to a 
            height of 7.9- 9.8 inches or 20-25 cm. This cat 
            breed has a medium-sized, lean body, wedge-shaped 
            head, and large, almond eyes. There will also 
            be the signature M shape on the forehead of an Abyssinian.</p>
        <h2>Abyssinian Personality & Temperment</h2>
        <p>The Abyssinian cat makes for an excellent 
            family pet. They are very intelligent, 
            active, playful, and social; these cats love 
            jumping, climbing, and interacting with their 
            owners and other pets. These cats have almost 
            dog-like characteristics with their desire for 
            affection and interaction with their owner. 
            This excellent quality can also be negative 
            when purchasing an Abyssinian since they need a 
            companian like another cat and should not be left 
            alone for too long. The Aby cat is usually a quiet 
            breed; however, rather than the classic meow, they 
            have soft chirrup-like vocalizations. 
        </p>
        <h2>Health Concerns</h2>
        <p>This breed is prone to gingivitis which can lead to 
            more severe periodontitis. They also have been known 
            for kidney disorders like Familial renal amyloidosis and 
            AA amyloidosis due to a mutation in the AA protein gene. 
            They can also have issues with hereditary blindness, 
            which is why choosing a reputable breeder is critical. </p>
        <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
        <p>Regarding the domestication of cats, it has been found 
            that the Abyssinian is one of the oldest types of domestic 
            animal in existence, with mummified cats found in Egyptian 
            tombs and were considered to be related to the gods by ancient Egyptians. </p>

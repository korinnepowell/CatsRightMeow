        <h2>Bengal Cat Breed</h2>
        <p>The Bengal cat breed is a domesticated cat created 
          from cross-breeding the Asian leopard cat with the 
          spotted Egyptian Mau. So this breed is a direct descendant 
          of wildcats and domesticated cats. These cats have a wild 
          appearance, with coats of marbling, rosettes, spots, and 
          arrowhead markings across shimmery golden fur. Bengal cats 
          have a slightly longer lifespan than the average 
          domesticated cat, between 10-16 years. These cats are also 
          slightly larger than the average house cat since selective 
          breeding has been used in an attempt to get a Bengal cat 
          closer in size to the original Asian leopard cat. Bengal 
          cats are also considered a hypoallergenic breed and less 
          likely to cause an allergic reaction in people since 
          they produce lower levels of allergens.</p>
        <h2>Bengal Personality & Temperment</h2>
        <p>The Bengal cat breed is a highly energetic breed of cat. 
          They are intelligent, energetic, and playful cats and need 
          an owner that can match their spirit. They have been known 
          to retrieve items and enjoy playing in the water. These 
          cats need a lot of regular play sessions, designated climbing 
          areas, and interactive toys. This will also help promote a 
          healthy lifestyle and prevent obesity. This cat breed is also 
          very affectionate with its owners and makes excellent family 
          pets. In between play sessions, they love cuddles.
        </p>
        <h2>Health Concerns</h2>
        <p>A major health concern with the Bengal breed is 
          Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or (HCM). This disease makes 
          the heart muscle abnormally thick, making it hard for 
          the cat's heart to pump blood. These cats are also 
          affected by a severe genetic disease called Bengal 
          progressive retinal atrophy or PRA. Any breeder 
          breeds these cats should carry this test out on 
          all of their cats since it is inexpensive, noninvasive, 
          and easy to perform. They should also offer the buyer 
          proof of a negative result.</p>
        <h2>Bengal Legal Information</h2>
        <p>In 1983, the International cat association officially 
          accepted the Bengal cat breed. However, there are some 
          legal restrictions to owning a Bengal cat in the United 
          States since it is a hybrid of a domestic and wildcat. 
          In Hawaii and New York owning a Bengal cat is prohibited. 
          In other areas like Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, 
          Massachusetts, Delaware, and Indiana, there are limits on 
          Bengal ownership. Most require the cat to be at least 
          four generations removed from its wild relative, or 
          permits are required to own this type of cat, so it is 
          good to know state laws before purchasing a Bengal cat.</p>

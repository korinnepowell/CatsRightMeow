        <h2>Himalayan Persian Cat Breed</h2>
        <p>The Himalayan Persian cat breed, or Himmie for short, 
            is a long-haired cat breed similar in type to the 
            Persian with signature blue eyes and point 
            coloration. The Himalayan Persian is a relatively 
            new breed developed in the United States and is a 
            mix of Siamese and Persian cats. The average Himalayan 
            cat has a  height of 10-12 inches or 25-30cm and a 
            length of 17-19inches or 43-48cm. An adult Himmie will 
            usually weigh between 7-12 lbs, and their lifespan 
            ranges between 9-15years. Himalayans are known for 
            their long white-cream silky coats with darker color 
            points that occur on the legs, face, and paws. Sometimes 
            these color points, like seal points, can be significant, 
            making the fur color look darker all over the body. 
            Often kittens are born with little to no color and 
            will develop full colorations over time.</p>
        <h2>Himalayan Persian Personality & Temperment</h2>
        <p>Himalayan Persian cats make excellent companions. These 
            cats are intelligent, friendly, gentle, and affectionate. 
            They are good with kids and other pets or are okay with 
            being alone. This feline breed is tuned in to their 
            owners and known for meeting them at the door. These cats 
            are very relaxed and more sedate than most breeds; however, 
            that does not mean they do not play, just that they are 
            less likely to climb curtains and get into trouble like 
            other breeds. Overall these cats adore attention and 
            affection from their owners and have sweet temperate 
            personalities. However, if you are looking for a low-maintenance 
            cat, the Himmie might not be the right choice—their 
            long, silky coats require daily care.
        </p>
        <h2>Health Concerns</h2>
        <p>Some common health conditions among Himalayans include:
            Like their close relatives, the Persian Himalayans 
            are prone to respiratory issues and feline asthma 
            because of their flattened faces. This issue also can 
            cause tear-staining, called epiphora. These cats can 
            also be prone to hereditary disorders like polycystic 
            kidney disease, which is characterized by the development 
            of multiple cysts on the cat's kidneys; this is why 
            finding a reputable breeder is essential. </p>
        <h2>Fun Fact !</h2>
        <p>In 2014 a Himalayan Persian named Colonel Meow 
            became the Guinness world record holder for 
            the cat with the longest fur. This also made 
            Colonel Meow an internet celebrity.</p>

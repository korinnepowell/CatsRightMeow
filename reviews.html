    <p>A friend referred me to cats right meow when 
        my older cat passed away. The lady that ran 
        this cattery was wonderful. She helped me 
        find the perfect kitten that would match my 
        lifestyle and fill the space in my heart. 
        I have now had Snowball for three years. He 
        is a healthy, beautiful Himalayan Persian 
        and my best friend. Thank you!</p>

    <p>I bought my Bengal cat, Spotsy, from the 
        Cats Right Meow cattery when he was only 
        eight weeks old. This past week he came 
        in 2nd place at the CFA cat fanciers 
        association annual Las Angeles, California 
        cat show. The Cats Right Meow breeders 
        are well known for having excellent show cats. 
        This is True! My Spotsy is only one year 
        old and has already placed in shows. He 
        is a beautiful well mannered cat with 
        excellent bloodlines! </p>

    <p>We recently bought our baby, Lilly. We were 
        looking for a hypoallergenic pet since 
        I have some slight allergies. The owner of 
        Cats Right Meow was super helpful and assured 
        us that if we needed to bring Lilly back,
         we could. So far, it has been a few months, 
         and I have had no reactions to her; in fact, 
         she has become the light of our life. 
         She is energetic and even loves walking 
         on a leash around the neighborhood. Thank you 
         to the owner who helped us find our furrever 
         baby at Cats Right Meow.</p>

    <p>Our Abyssinian cat Leo is the best cat in the 
        world. We bought him for our daughter. 
        However, he has won over the hearts of 
        the whole family. Thank you, Cats Right Meow!</p>

    <p>Five years ago, we bought Victoria from 
        the Cats Right Meow cattery. She was 
        one of the most beautiful Himalayan 
        cats we had ever seen. We knew immediately 
        when we walked into the large cat room that 
        she was the one for us. She ran to us and purred 
        loudly. We took Victoria home that day and she 
        became our fur baby. She is sweet and loves to 
        cuddle. Recently we decided to expand our little 
        family and get another kitten. The only place we 
        will ever go is Cats Right Meow Cattery. So this 
        time, we picked a rambunctious little lady and 
        named her Isabella. Isie is undoubtedly a handful; 
        however, it brings the kitten out in Victoria again. 
        Isie will pounce on her, and Victoria will chase 
        her around the house. We are so thankful for 
        our to babies!</p>
